			Without well-written paragraphs that flow logically from one idea to the next and that inform and help support understanding of the research </br>problem being investigated, your paper will not be viewed as credible by the reader. More than simply a collection of sentences, a paragraph must </br> possess a controlling idea [i.e., the thinking strategy, opinion, or attitude that provides a framework from which to interpret the author’s </br>position concerning the research problem]. The paragraph should then explain the idea in a structurally coherent way and be </br>sufficiently developed to inform the reader about that idea in a way that transitions naturally into the next paragraph or section of your paper.
